* What does the term *plot* mean in data visualization?
* Understand the differences and use-cases for:

  * **Scatter plots**
  * **Line graphs**
  * **Bar charts**
  * **Histograms**

#### ðŸ”¹ Introduction to `matplotlib`

* What is `matplotlib` and why is it widely used in data science?

#### ðŸ”¹ Visualization Skills

* How to generate different types of graphs using `matplotlib`
* Techniques for:

  * Labeling your axes and title

###  Getting Started: Installing `matplotlib` 3.0

To follow along with the project, make sure to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install --user matplotlib==3.0
pip install --user Pillow
```

For some systems (especially Linux), you might also need:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

This ensures `matplotlib` works correctly with graphical interfaces.
